# AGENTS.md for Terraform Project

This file provides instructions for AI coding agents working on this Terraform Project.

## Project Overview

This project is a Terraform module designed to provision and manage an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). It creates foundational networking infrastructure including the VPC, public and private subnets, route tables, and gateways required for a secure and scalable AWS environment.

## Module and Repository Structure

Organize your Terraform project as follows:

```text
├── .gitignore
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── main.tf
├── outputs.tf
├── providers.tf
├── variables.tf
├── versions.tf
├── docs/
│   ├── CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
│   ├── CONTRIBUTING.md
│   ├── PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
│   ├── README_footer.md
│   ├── README_header.md
│   ├── SECURITY.md
```

### Required Files and Directories

- `README.md` – Required in the root module. Generated automatically (e.g., via Terraform-Docs). Do not edit manually.
- `docs/README_header.md` - Describe the purpose of the code and provide required context.
- `docs/README_footer.md` - Provide links to external documentation used to generate the code.
- `main.tf` – Primary resource and data source definitions.
- `outputs.tf` – Output value definitions (alphabetical order).
- `providers.tf` – Provider configurations.
- `variables.tf` – Input variable definitions (alphabetical order with required variables at the top).
- `versions.tf` - Terraform version and provider requirements.

## Tools and Frameworks

- AI Agents should format their generated HCL optimally as local `terraform fmt`, `terraform init`, and `terraform validate` cannot be run directly during the session due to the VCS-driven workflow.
- Formatting and CI/CD validation are handled by an automated VCS workflow, meaning the Agent does not need to run a local linter or validation operations locally. Do your best to output valid HCL code and do not try to run Terraform commands in the terminal.
- Use `terraform-docs` to generate the `README.md` file using the header and footer (you don't need to do this manually if the CI does it, but you must create the header/footer files).

## README_header.md

When editing or creating `docs/README_header.md`, ensure it contains:

- A description of the general purpose of the code.
- A `Permissions` section containing the permissions required to provision resources for each provider.
- An `Authentications` section containing the authentication details required for each provider.
- A `Features` section containing key features managed by the code.

## README_footer.md

When editing or creating `docs/README_footer.md`, ensure it contains:

- An `External Documentation` section providing links to relevant external documentation used to develop the code (e.g., HashiCorp Vault Provider docs, TFE Secrets Engine documentation, Vault JWT Auth Method, and HCP Terraform API docs).

## Code Guidelines

Refer to CONTRIBUTING.md for general coding guidelines. HashiCorp's Terraform style guide should be applied for all code generated.

## Resource Naming

- Use descriptive nouns separated by underscores.
- Do not include the resource type in the resource name.
- Wrap resource type and name in double quotes.
- Example: `resource "aws_eks_cluster" "main"` not `resource "aws_eks_cluster" "eks_main"`.

## Version Management

- Prefer the pessimistic constraint operator (`~>`) for modules and providers to allow safe updates within a compatible version range.
- Avoid using only the equals (`=`) operator unless you must lock to a single version for reproducibility or known issues.
- Pin the Terraform version using `required_version` in the `terraform` block.

## Provider Configuration

- Always include a default provider configuration.
- Define all providers in the same file (`providers.tf`).
- Define the default provider first, then aliased providers.
- Use `alias` as the first parameter in non-default provider blocks.

## Security and Secrets

- Never commit `.terraform` directories or local state files.
- The project leverages dynamic provider credentials natively supported by Terraform Cloud / Enterprise workspaces or the VCS workflow.
- Access secrets securely via workspace variables.
- Set `sensitive = true` for sensitive variables across all definitions.

## State Management

- State storage is managed natively by HCP Terraform workspaces. Data sharing between configurations relies on standard data sources or `tfe_outputs` where cross-workspace values are required.
